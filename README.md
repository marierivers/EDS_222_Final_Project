# EDS 222 Statistics for Environmental Data Science
## Final Project -  Does Environmental Quality Influence Where People Live?

This analysis was completed as my final project for a Statistics for Environmental Data Science class. The goal of the assignment was to explore an environmental data science question for which you do not know the answer. I designed a statistical analysis to answer the question: Does Environmental Quality Influence Where People Live? To answer this question, US Census data was used to estimate population change and US EPA Environmental Quality Index data was used as a proxy for environmental quality. Both of these datasets are aggregated at the county level.

For the project requirements, the professor was more interested in our analysis than the code used to clean the data and calculate statistics. A blog post prepared for the assignment can be found on my website
https://marierivers.github.io/posts/environmental-quality-population-change/. 

This file `eqi_pop_change_analysis.Rmd` in this repository contains code used read in and clean all data files and for the statistical analysis/discussion.
